# ALU_Verification
<p = "justify">A complete verification environment was implemented in SystemVerilog for an ALU to ensure that the ALU
functions correctly and reliably, and to detect present bugs if any.</p>
<p = "justify">The ALU (Device Under Test) had 3 bugs, namely Subtraction,  Logical OR and Logical NAND 
operations, which were detected using the testbench.</p>
